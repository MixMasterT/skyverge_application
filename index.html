              <dt>Why are you looking?</dt>
              <dd>I have acquired new skills and I want to use them.</dd>
              <dt>Can you summarize your remote work experience?</dt>
              <dd>In graduate school I worked as an academic editor and
                and translator. This work was remote because I did
                it on my own, and sent in the completed work to the client.
              </dd>
              <dt>What should we definitely look at?</dt>
              <dd>You should definitely take into account my history as a
                teacher, because that helped me develop excellent communication
                skills, and hone my ability to find out what someone knows
                or doesn't know by asking straight-forward quesions.
              </dd>
              <dt>What is not on your resume that we should know?</dt>
              <dd>I speak fluent Chinese, and have excellent knowledge of
                Chinese and Taiwanese culture. I could help provide support
                and outreach to Chinese customers.
              </dd>
              <dt>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavasScript knowledge?</dt>
              <dd>I have been building webpages with HTML and CSS for at least
                five years. I understand the big picture of how these technologies
                fit together and change over time. More recently, I have
                become interested in software engineering. Here are a few
                basic principles that show some understanding:
                <ul>
                  <li>The <a href='https://www.w3.org/'>W3C</a> is the authority on web standards</li>
                  <li><a href='https://www.w3.org/'>Mozilla</a> actively develops the JavaScript language</li>
                  <li>Scoping and asynchronous behavior are two of JavaScript's biggest gotchas</li>
                  <li>Most developers today use CSS preprocessors and or frameworks such as Bootstrap
                    rather than writing their own raw CSS
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </dd>
              <dt>Why are you a good fit for this role?</dt>
              <dd>I am very patient and good natured. I am also careful with words
                and skillful at communication, both verbally and in writing. Furthermore,
                I have good general technical knowledge relating to the topics that
                most Woocommerce customers will be interested in.
              </dd>
              <dt>Anything else we should know?</dt>
              <dd>I love music. I play capoeira. I am a DJ.</dd>

          <q>Iâ€™m considering switching to Product Customizer.
            Does your app allow live image previews?
          </q>
          <h3>Possible response from me:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Dear Customer,<br /><br />
              Thanks for reaching out. We appreciate your feedback regarding
              features that you consider desireable. As yet, we have not implemented
              live image previews. However, we do have nice imaging features built-in
              to our platform. You can learn more about our dynamic, controllable,
              360&deg; image rotation feature <a href='https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-360-image/'>here</a>.
              I will be sure to let our development team know that you are interested in
              live image previews, and I will let you know what I hear back from them.
              Please let me know if there is anything else I can do.<br />
              Best Regards,<br /><br />

          <h2>What was your last online purchase? What steps did you take in that process?<h2>
            <h3>The last thing I bought online was three roundtrip airplane tickets</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>I checked pricing through several carriers and aggregator websites to get a general sense of what was available.</li>
              <li>I noted which carriers were offering direct-flight service between my destinations and the approximate prices for tickets with each one.</li>
              <li>I checked the baggage cost policies for the airlines offering direct-flight service along my desired route.</li>
              <li>I recognized that two free bags would be worth over one-hundred dollars per round-trip since we will have lots of luggage, and that this benefit made one carrier (Southwest) much more cost-effective than the others.</li>
              <li>I then checked the listing for sale-fares on Southwest, and noticed that one of the airports in my vicinity had a discounted direct-flight fare to my destingation.</li>
              <li>I then reserved the tickets.</li>
              <li>Before finalizing the purchase, I confirmed the itinerary with my travel partners.</li>
